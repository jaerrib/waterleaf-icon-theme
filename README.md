# Waterleaf icon theme
Waterleaf is a spiritual successor to the Debonaire/Paper-Q4OS icon theme. It was created because the development of that icon theme had grown beyond the scope of the Q4OS Linux project. Further development has continued to be targeted towards Q4OS and the Trinity/Plasma desktop environments, but is also suitable for other distributions and DEs.

Waterleaf is currently based primarily on Paper icons by Sam Hewitt. It also mixes application icons from the Deepin and Papirus icon themes with original work (mostly TDE specific icons).

An experimental branch has been introduced by the Q4OS Team as of July 2020 with the intent to rebase entirely on Papirus. This has the advantage of incorporating the work of a larger team with a faster development pace and moving towards all icons being in svg format. Waterleaf will continue to differentiate itself by focusing on Q4OS, Trinity and Plasma while expanding and refining icons specific to those projects.
